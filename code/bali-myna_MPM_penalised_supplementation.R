    # 2. our census data are pre-breeding. So, birds with age 0 in the current timestep do not breed until the next timestep, because the next breeding season follows the next census. This means immature females should be excluded from fecundity calculations, unlike if it was a post-breeding census. 
    # 3. as it is a pre-breeding census, all of our fecundity rates should NOT be adjusted down to account for mortality (birds breed immediately after census - presumed that there is almost no mortality). Fecundity rates should NOT be subjected to stage-specific survival rate. 
    # 4. it is likely that birds breeding for the first time are not as productive as full adults, partly because a lot of the 1st year males may not even breed. So a penalty should be applied to the fecundity rate of 1st year birds (in addition to the survival rate penalty)
